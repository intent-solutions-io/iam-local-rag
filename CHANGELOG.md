## [Unreleased]

## [1.1.0] - 2024-12-22

### 🚀 Major Features

**Hybrid Cloud RAG Platform** - Complete transformation from local-only to multi-provider hybrid cloud architecture.

### Added

#### Phase 2: Cloud Provider Integration
- **ProviderRouter**: Intelligent provider selection with mode-based constraints (LOCAL/HYBRID/CLOUD)
- **PolicyRedactor**: Hybrid safety enforcement - documents stay local, only snippets sent to cloud
- **Anthropic Claude Provider**: Official SDK integration with Claude 3.5 Sonnet support
- **OpenAI Provider**: GPT-4 + text-embedding-ada-002 (1536-dim) with batch processing
- **Google Vertex AI Provider**: Gemini 1.5 Pro + textembedding-gecko (768-dim) with multi-region support

#### Phase 3: Team Collaboration
- **SQLite Run Ledger**: Complete audit trail for all index/query operations
  - Tracks document hashes, excerpt hashes, provider usage
  - Workspace-level statistics and analytics
  - Compliance-ready (GDPR, HIPAA, SOC 2)
- **Workspace REST API**: Multi-tenant isolation
  - `GET /workspaces` - List all workspaces with stats
  - `POST /workspaces` - Create new workspace
  - `GET /runs` - Query audit trail with filters
  - `GET /runs/{run_id}` - Get specific run details

#### Phase 4: Quality & Usability
- **75+ Automated Tests**: Comprehensive test coverage
  - Unit tests (router, policy, ledger)
  - Integration tests (full RAG workflows)
  - API tests (FastAPI endpoints)
- **Streamlit UI** (`app_nexus.py`): Enterprise-grade interface
  - 4 tabs: Index, Query, Analytics, Run Ledger
  - Multi-provider configuration
  - Hybrid safety controls
  - Real-time metrics dashboard
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated testing on all pushes/PRs

### Changed
- Reorganized project structure to comply with MASTER DIRECTORY STANDARDS (2025-10-06)
- Moved all source code to `02-Src/`
- Moved all tests to `03-Tests/`
- Moved scripts to `05-Scripts/`
- Created standardized directory structure (01-Docs, 02-Src, 03-Tests, etc.)
- Added `.directory-standards.md` reference file
- Updated README.md and created CLAUDE.md with directory standards references
- Removed legacy empty directories (archive, completed-docs, docs, documents, working-mds, professional-templates)
- Enhanced RAGPipeline with ledger integration and policy enforcement

### Security
- **Hybrid Safe Mode**: Documents never leave local environment
- **Snippet Truncation**: Configurable MAX_SNIPPET_LENGTH (default 4000 chars)
- **Excerpt Hashing**: Pre-truncation hashes for audit verification
- **Payload Validation**: Outbound content validation before cloud transmission

### Documentation
- Complete upgrade guide: `01-Docs/500-upgrade-summary-phases-2-4.md`
- Architecture diagrams and data flow illustrations
- Configuration reference with all env vars
- Migration guide from local-only to hybrid
- Security and compliance documentation

### Performance
- Multi-provider support maintains sub-2s query latency
- Workspace isolation with separate vector stores
- Batch processing for embeddings (100-250 per batch)
- Exponential backoff retry logic for cloud providers

### Compatibility
- ✅ **Zero breaking changes** - local-only mode still works
- ✅ **Backward compatible** - existing APIs unchanged
- ✅ **Optional cloud** - defaults to LOCAL mode if no API keys

### Contributors
- Jeremy Longshore (Intent Solutions)

## [1.0.0] - 2024-09-16

### Added

- LangChain RAG pipeline orchestration
- Multi-format document support (PDF, TXT, MD, DOCX, HTML)
- Performance optimization features (caching, parallel processing)
- One-line installer script
- Comprehensive documentation and README
- Test suite with pytest
- GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline

### Features
- 100% local processing (no cloud dependencies)
